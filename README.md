#Dark_Mode_pro

This project implements a toggle button that switches the website between light mode and dark mode. The button also changes to a neon color when clicked, and the user's preference (light or dark mode) is stored locally, ensuring the preferred mode is applied on future visits.

## Features

- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Switches the website theme between light mode and dark mode.
- **User Preference Storage**: Stores the user's theme preference using `localStorage` so that the preferred mode is retained on page reload or future visits.
- **Neon Toggle Button**: The toggle button changes to a neon color when clicked, adding a stylish visual effect.
